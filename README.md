The goal is to reach the Yellow point situated at the top-right corner before the labyrinth vanishes, adding a thrilling time constraint of approximately one minute. Test your agility and strategy as you race against the clock in this adrenaline-pumping challenge!

The maze is generated using [Random Transversal Algorithm](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/70a28267db0354261476).
